The goal of the [Cash Improvement Proposal (CHIP) process](https://blog.bitjson.com/bitcoin-cash-upgrade-2023/#why-chips) is to coordinate upgrades to Bitcoin Cash without a central authority by developing proposals in a collaborative, public process.

**CHIP maintainers are expected to actively seek out stakeholders and demonstrate widespread ecosystem approval.**

This includes approval from nodes, wallets, and other open source software projects, educational institutions and community initiatives, and industry actors like exchanges, miners, services, and other businesses.

## Stakeholder Responses

The CHIP maintainer has contacted the following stakeholders for approval of this specification. Public records are kept of stakeholder responses to the following standard request:

> Beyond simply being able to represent other assets on Bitcoin Cash, CashTokens also enable decentralized applications on Bitcoin Cash comparable to Ethereum (ETH) contract functionality, while retaining Bitcoin Cash's >1000x efficiency advantage in transaction and block validation.
>
> —<cite>Jason Dreyzehner, [Chaingraph](https://chaingraph.cash/), [Libauth](https://libauth.org/), and [Bitauth IDE](https://ide.bitauth.com)</cite>

> Support for tokens has been a frequent request by members of the BCH community. However, this CashTokens CHIP is a lot more than that. Not only do these primitives give BCH the capability to have traditional tokens akin to those found on other chains, it also gives BCH incredibly powerful smart-contract capabilities comparable to those available in EVM. And best of all, it does it at effectively zero-cost to scaling and in a way that aligns naturally with BCH's UTXO model. In my opinion, this is the elegant, groundbreaking, approach that many of us have been waiting for and, thus, this CHIP has my full endorsement.
>
> —<cite>Jim Hamill, [CashTags](https://tags.infra.cash/), [Developers.Cash](https://developers.cash/), and [ScanToPay.cash](https://scantopay.cash/)</cite>

> I believe CashTokens is a much needed addition to the BCH consensus rules that will be very lightweight and low cost (as in zero cost) for anybody not interesting in using it. However, for those interested in using it, it unlocks a whole slew of usecases and makes BCH much more than just cash – but brings along programmable money and miner-validated tokens. We need such features in BCH to compete with other coins. BCH is already very fast and scalable, and if it also has utxo-based tokens and better smart contracts, there is no reason for us not to get to the moon and beyond!

> —<cite>Calin Culianu, [Bitcoin Cash Node](https://bitcoincashnode.org/), [Fulcrum](https://github.com/cculianu/Fulcrum), and [Electron Cash](https://electroncash.org/)</cite>

> Approved! This CHIP adds valuable and powerful capabilities to Bitcoin Cash. I am particularly pleased that it does so efficiently and without at all harming the monetary properties of the coin.
>
> —<cite>Andrew#128, [Bitcoin Cash Node](https://bitcoincashnode.org/) and [Electron Cash](https://electroncash.org/)</cite>

> The idea of UTXO tokens on Bitcoin is as old as `OP_CHECKCOLORVERIFY` circa 2013 so this concludes almost a decade long process! As someone who spent more than a year trying to move "Group Tokenization" forward, I am thrilled with how it has evolved and converged to a really elegant technical solution designed to perfectly integrate with the existing Script VM. CashTokens will unlock so much power for application builders, and all that at no expense to existing users or scalability! I fully support this proposal!
>
> —<cite>bitcoincashautist, [CHIP-2021-02 Unforgeable Groups](https://gitlab.com/0353F40E/group-tokenization) Owner</cite>

> CashTokens will be a great addition to BCH. Not only because it adds real, miner-validated tokens to the ecosystem, but because its design makes it possible for transaction script designers to create complex contracts in fewer bytes. This in turn means even more room for innovation, and possibilities that don't exist anywhere else.
>
> —<cite>Andrew Groot, [Bitcoin Verde](https://bitcoinverde.org/)</cite>

> The Cashtokens CHIP is the thing that makes me the most optimistic about BCH long term by far. It perfectly builds upon previous smart contract upgrades and really sets BCH apart from other blockchains. Excited for the possibilities this enables!
>
> —<cite>Mathieu Geukens, [bestbchwallets.com](https://www.bestbchwallets.com/)</cite>

> I support the CashTokens CHIP for lock-in. I'm excited to use these features in flipstarter.me and other projects for better user experience, decentralization, and censorship-resistance — in a way that actually scales.
>
> —<cite>Sahid Miller, [Flipstarter.me](https://flipstarter.me/) and [Anyonecanpay.me](https://anyonecanpay.me)</cite>

> I believe that CashTokens CHIP is a very important upgrade for BCH. SLP was one reason I favored BCH when I had to chose between coins years ago. I think CashTokens are the solution to fix SLP issues like token burn, indexers and many other.
>
> —<cite>𝖆𝖐𝖆-𝖉, [tbch.googol.cash](https://tbch.googol.cash/)</cite>

> I fully support the deployment of CashTokens on Bitcoin Cash mainnet.

> Cash tokens is possibly the longest researched project with several teams starting and abandoning the project. In Bitcoin Cash the first paper was published in 2017. It was called op-group. I've been involved with all of the revisions in one way or another and for me the latest CHIP is "good enough". Which means that in my opinion it can be used to elevate the chain to allow many more usecases and we can depend on it being maintainable and usable for many years to come.

> The demise of SLP has cost the BCH community a great deal but demonstrated a need for on-chain safe tokens and enhanced expressiveness while staying within the original goals of BitcoinCash. CashTokens has exceeded the expectations and is exactly what is needed to bring BCH back to the right balance between safety, scalability, and expressiveness. This is the most important improvement to the BCH VM ever.

> This proposal makes two novel contributions to Bitcoin Cash. First, it elucidates that fungible and non-fungible tokens should be cryptocurrency primitives rather than applications. And second, it shows how these primitives can be introduced with a minimally disputive change to the protocol. The implications are nothing less than revolutionary. Stablecoins, prediction markets and other applications will be able to operate with the high throughput and low cost that Bitcoin Cash has already demonstrated. If Bitcoin Cash is to become world money then we must adopt this CHIP.
>
> —<cite>Richard Brady, [Coinbooth](https://coinbooth.io)</cite>

> Due to the proposal's name, it was widely expected to be a straightforward "consensus tokenization" proposal for BCH, comparable to colored coins and SLP protocols that came before it. CashTokens, however, is designed with UTXO smart contract interactions as a priority, and it should be viewed as powerful, message-carrying general computing "tokens" instead of limited-function tradable asset-carriers. At General Protocols, we believe we are in a position to take full advantage of the proposal once it is activated.

> Tokens are inevitable part of experimentation process on blockchains and they enable a lot of innovation by creating a financial incentive to entrepreneurs. And since we can do it much more effectively and cheaper than on other chains, I say we should do it! I don't fully understand the technical details of the proposal, but I trust the people behind it. These people are way smarter than me and I trust they'll do their jobs well.

> We fully support the CHIP-2022-02-CashTokens to be activated in the upcoming upgrade and we are excited to enable support for CashTokens within the Zapit wallet along with all of its use cases. Looking forward to enabling all our current features and services provided to tokens for the new token format as well.

> We APPROVE. Thanks for your work!

> —<cite>[BitcoinVN](https://bitcoinvn.io/)</cite>

> CashTokens is a culmination of years of experimentation on tokenization in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash blockchains. By implementing this as a contract-issued commitment, it has provided developers with a way, not only to issue tokens, but also to build advanced decentralized applications. Peer-to-peer cash will become more programmable than ever. As one of the prominent developers of user-facing applications in Bitcoin Cash, we are very much excited by the possibilities this upgrade can enable. Thus, we fully support the deployment of CashTokens for May 2023 upgrade.
